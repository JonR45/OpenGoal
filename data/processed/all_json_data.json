Premier League winner and 100-cap Irish International, Damien Duff joins Si this week to talk through the winger's illustrious career at the top level of the game.\n\nDamien chats with us about his early start at Blackburn coming through under the likes of Kenny Dalglish, Roy Hodgson and Graeme Souness before announcing himself to the world with his stand-out display for Ireland at the 2002 World Cup in Japan & South Korea.\n\nHe also gives his take on the Roy Keane vs Mick McCarthy bust-up that kicked off in Saipan as well as discussion the other big characters he was involved with in his career at Chelsea including Ranieri and of course Jose Mourinho who he secured 2 Premier League titles with during an historic era at Stamford Bridge.\n\nWe also cover his difficult time at Newcastle, the highs of reaching the UEFA Cup Final with Fulham as well as the crazy story of his whirlwind stint at Celtic where he went from reserve team manager to on the touchline with the 1st team achieving history alongside Neil Lennon and John Kennedy.\n\nWhat a career and what an interview! Enjoy!\n\n#Chelsea #NUFC #Celtic"

He'd go onto recover and continue his position as a leader in the dressing room to eventually help the team to become treble champions once more in his final year.\n\nIt's all in there as Lorenzo is added to our long list of candid interviews with many of British football's top names!",

He'd go onto recover and continue his position as a leader in the dressing room to eventually help the team to become treble champions once more in his final year.\n\nIt's all in there as Lorenzo is added to our long list of candid interviews with many of British football's top names!"

This start kicked off an eventful career at Celtic which saw Sid play with a number of characters including the Three Amigos under Tommy Burns before eventually clinching a league title in 1998 to stop Rangers pursuit of 10 in a row.\n\nSimon also reflects on his time as assistant manager to Jackie McNamara at Patrick Thistle and Dundee Utd including the many ups and downs that come with football management.",

This start kicked off an eventful career at Celtic which saw Sid play with a number of characters including the Three Amigos under Tommy Burns before eventually clinching a league title in 1998 to stop Rangers pursuit of 10 in a row.\n\nSimon also reflects on his time as assistant manager to Jackie McNamara at Patrick Thistle and Dundee Utd including the many ups and downs that come with football management."

The big man talks through his football education in Trinidad and the fascinating story which led him to land in Scotland and try to make it as a professional footballer.\n\nHe chats through the difficulties in adapting to the Scottish weather and culture as he went through trials at various clubs before ending up at Raith Rovers.\n\nMarvin also delves into the highs and lows at Livingston from finishing 3rd in the top league to the club's financial oblivion which saw a number of peculiar incidents occur towards the end of his time there.\n\nAnd of course the lads touch on his move to Rangers and how it all came about."

                            "description": "In Part 2 of our interview with Rangers legend, Arthur Numan, the Dutchman gives Si a thorough insight into his Rangers career from beginning to end. \n\nHe discusses the surreal experience of sitting in with the fans when Rangers clinched the title at Celtic Park in a dramatic game which involved referee Hugh Dallas being struck by a coin. \n\nThe chat also goes into Arthur's regrets over the club's European performances during his time as well as how he felt during the transition from his mentor Advocaat's reign to Alex McLeish taking over as Manger which led to a fitting farewell for Arthur as the club achieved a treble in his final season which included a dramatic final day title race with Celtic.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Subscribe - https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCArk93C2pbOvkv6jWz-3kAg\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Visit our website - open-goal.co.uk\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Bet with William Hill - williamhill.co.uk\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Contact us - info@opengoal.co.uk ; http://www.open-goal.co.uk/contact-open-goal/"

Kolo gives Si an insight into the qualities of that team and what made them such a top team.\n\nKolo also discusses his remaining time at Arsenal which included the Champions League in 2006 as well as what led to his departure from a club he could never see himself leaving.",

                            "description": "We welcome a big name to our first show of the year with double Premier League winning and Ivory Coast internationalist, Kolo Toure sitting down with Si Ferry to chat through his career.\n\nIn the first of our two-part series with the Ivorian, we are given a fascinating insight into the football education Kolo received from his local academy which brought through the likes of his brother YaYa, Gervinho, Zakora and many others.\n\nHe tells Simon about transitioning into the Premier League during his early days at Arsenal and the support he received from the more senior pros in the team at the time.\n\nSuch support aided him in becoming a vital component of the Arsenal Invincibles team which managed to win the Premier League without losing a single game the entire season. Kolo gives Si an insight into the qualities of that team and what made them such a top team.\n\nKolo also discusses his remaining time at Arsenal which included the Champions League in 2006 as well as what led to his departure from a club he could never see himself leaving."

In part 1 of our 2 part interview with the West Ham and Celtic cult icon, Frank discusses his early football upbringing growing up in the Milton and sacrificing his football to go watch his beloved Celtic every week. \n\nA late developer to the professional game, he talks through his quick ascension up the footballing ranks from getting his start at St Mirren to moving down south with West Ham during a period which saw them become agonisingly close to securing the First Division title.\n\nNo interview would be complete of course without getting a word from Frank on the London nightlife he enjoyed as he tells us how his life changed overnight after he appeared on the talkshow 'Wogan' which saw him claim instant celebrity status.\n\nHe also discusses how the boy from the stands ended up living the dream after moving to Celtic to play under his idol Billy McNeill. A moment of pride for both him and his family.",

In part 1 of our 2 part interview with the West Ham and Celtic cult icon, Frank discusses his early football upbringing growing up in the Milton and sacrificing his football to go watch his beloved Celtic every week. \n\nA late developer to the professional game, he talks through his quick ascension up the footballing ranks from getting his start at St Mirren to moving down south with West Ham during a period which saw them become agonisingly close to securing the First Division title.\n\nNo interview would be complete of course without getting a word from Frank on the London nightlife he enjoyed as he tells us how his life changed overnight after he appeared on the talkshow 'Wogan' which saw him claim instant celebrity status.\n\nHe also discusses how the boy from the stands ended up living the dream after moving to Celtic to play under his idol Billy McNeill. A moment of pride for both him and his family."

He discusses coming through the youth ranks at Ibrox, breaking into the 1st team under Ally McCoist during a tumultuous time at the club and his much talked-about departure from Rangers when he was sold to Brentford for \u00a31 million.\n\nThe lads also analyse the weekend's action with Celtic extending their lead to 3 points at the top-of-the-league after Rangers dropped points against Dundee United at Tannadice and we discuss the most recent managerial appointments at Aberdeen, Dundee & St Mirren.\n\n#RangersFC #SPFL #Podcast",

He discusses coming through the youth ranks at Ibrox, breaking into the 1st team under Ally McCoist during a tumultuous time at the club and his much talked-about departure from Rangers when he was sold to Brentford for \u00a31 million.\n\nThe lads also analyse the weekend's action with Celtic extending their lead to 3 points at the top-of-the-league after Rangers dropped points against Dundee United at Tannadice and we discuss the most recent managerial appointments at Aberdeen, Dundee & St Mirren.\n\n#RangersFC #SPFL #Podcast"
