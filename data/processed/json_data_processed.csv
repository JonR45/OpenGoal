The candid chat with Ireland's record caps-holder for a goalie goes back to his early career at Celtic where he discusses how the club let him slip through the net during a turbulent time in the East End of Glasgow, to his time with Kenny Dalglish at Blackburn and Newcastle and all the amazing moments and memories he experienced from his time at St James' Park both in the Premier League and in Europe.

We of course also chat about his time with Man City at the start of the Sheik Mansour revolution as well as his historic moments and funniest teammate stories with the National Team including the 2002 World Cup, Thierry Henry's Hand Ball and Euro 2012.
