Derek Ferguson and Frank McAvennie pay tribute to a man they both worked under at Ibrox and the National Team as they share their favourite memories of him.\n\nWe also look back on the previous night's events as Aberdeen were unlucky not to take away 3 points from their game against Rangers at Ibrox, Ross County shocked the league with a surprise 5-0 win away at Dundee and Celtic run riot in the 1st half against Hibs at Easter Road.\n\n#WalterSmith #SPFL #Football"
